## Earn Your MFA in Creative Writing at Temple
If you are a fiction writer or poet, the graduate Creative Writing program offers fiction writers and poets the opportunity to develop your craft in a two-year MFA program. The program combines small workshops each semester, one-on-one manuscript tutorials and graduate courses in creative writing topics and literature. Workshops are supplemented by individual consultations with visiting writers-in-residence and a series of readings by prominent writers (link to Poets & Writers page). 

the curriculum supports students as they gain technique and self-confidence and prepare to hand in their MFA theses in their final semester. The supportive environment also helps our students move successfully from the MFA into the highly competitive world of submissions to journals and book publishers. 

Temple has an excellent faculty of writers in both genres, representing a wide range of aesthetics. 

Through small workshops each semester and one-on-one manuscript tutorials with our resident faculty in the second year, the curriculum supports students as they gain technique and self-confidence and prepare to hand in their MFA theses in their final semester. The supportive environment also helps our students move successfully from the MFA into the highly competitive world of submissions to journals and book publishers. 

Workshops are supplemented by individual consultations with visiting writers-in-residence and a series of readings by prominent writers. For more information, please look at our Poets & Writers events page. Students also have the opportunity to work on our online literary journal, [Tinge Magazine](http://www.tingemagazine.org/) which is graduate student-edited.

Faculty who have taught in the program in the past include such noted writers and scholars as David Bradley, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Pattie McCarthy, Toby Olson, Sonia Sanchez, Susan Stewart, and William Van Wert. Current faculty include Samuel R. Delany, Don Lee, Joan Mellen, Jena Osman, Alan Singer, and Brian Teare. The program also hosts a visiting fiction writer and a visiting poet each year; visitors have included Peter Carey, Alexander Chee, Robert Creeley, Robert Coover, Anita Desai, Brian Evenson, C.S. Giscombe, Jaimy Gordon, Mat Johnson, Bhanu Kapil, Jonathan Lethem, Carole Maso, Anne Waldman, C.D. Wright, and Alice Notley, and many others. 

Please go to the Temple University Creative Writing [M.F.A.Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/templecreativewriting) page for current updates.

## Degree requirements for the M.F.A. program

This is a two-year, 33-credit program. The curricular requirements are as follows:

- Four fiction workshops or four poetry workshops, one each semester. 12 credits total
- One tutorial, one-on-one with a resident faculty mentor. 3 credits
- One special topics in creative writing course. 3 credits
- One course focused on issues of craft in either fiction or poetry. 3 credits*
- Two literature courses drawn from the graduate offerings, three credits each. 6 credits
- One elective course, which may include the composition practicum (required of students funded with a teaching assistantship or university fellowship); a literature course in the graduate program; a graduate course in another department. 3 credits**
- Master’s project (thesis). 3 credits
- Comprehensive examination in either poetry or fiction, consisting of a 10–15-page paper

*In special circumstances, poetry students may substitute a literature, arts, or writing-related course for the craft class. This would require the permission of the student’s advisor and the Creative Writing director; approval will take into account the student’s entire course of study.

** As the program also values the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration, courses offered within the School of Communications and Theater (including Film and Media Arts), Boyer School of Music and Dance and the Tyler School of the Arts may be used to fulfill this elective.

- Students admitted to the M.F.A. program with funding must attend full time.
- Students admitted to the M.F.A. program without funding may attend part time.

## How to Apply

## Admissions Overview

Although not required, we prefer applicants to the MFA Program in Creative Writing to hold a bachelor’s degree in English or creative writing, or to have taken a significant number of workshops or literature classes as an undergraduate. However, in the past, students without this background have performed well in the program. Therefore, we consider the entire application package in our admission decisions.

The minimum admission standard for all graduate students is an undergraduate grade point average of B, or 3.0 (see bottom of this page for exceptions), or the functional equivalent for students who have attended universities outside of the United States.

Submit the following application materials to be considered for admission (details below):

1. Graduate School Application through Banner
2. Optional GRE (recommended for fellowship consideration)
3. TOEFL or other tests (for international students only)
4. Official Transcripts (from all colleges attended)
5. Creative Writing Application Form
6. Résumé or CV
7. Personal Statement
7. Writing Sample
8. Three Letters of Recommendation

Materials may be submitted via one of these delivery methods (details below):

- Email
- Interfolio (additional fees will be incurred)
- Regular Mail

All materials should be submitted or postmarked by **February 15**. If you would like to be considered for a fellowship, please turn in your materials (including the optional GRE scores that are recommended for fellowship consideration) by December 15. Applications submitted after **December 15** will still be considered for a fellowship (even those without the recommended GRE scores) or a teaching assistantship, but those meeting the initial deadline will be prioritized. Basically, if you are seeking funding through a fellowship or teaching assistantship, the earlier you submit your application, the better. (Information about fellowships and teaching assistantships can be found on the Financial Aid Information page.) After the February 15 deadline, applications may still be considered on a rolling, case-by-case basis (though not for funding), depending on the availability of space and the applicant’s credentials; inquire by emailing [creatwrt@temple.edu](mailto:creatwrt@temple.edu). Applications are accepted only for fall admission.

Writers (or graduate students from other departments at Temple) who wish to take a class in the MFA program as non-matriculated students should inquire about the possibility first, emailing [creatwrt@temple.edu](mailto:creatwrt@temple.edu) at least two weeks before the start of the semester about specific classes. Check Temple’s [course schedule](http://www.temple.edu/apply/common/cdcheck.asp) (select the semester, then look under English, Graduate). If there is space and the instructor is amenable, you will most likely be asked for a writing sample and other information for further consideration. Non-matriculated students may transfer up to 9 credits for courses with a grade of B or higher upon admission to the program.

Application Materials

1. **General Graduate School Application:** Complete the general Graduate School application on Temple’s [online Banner system](http://www.temple.edu/grad/admissions/howtoapply.htm). (There is an option on the website to download a paper application, which should be mailed to: Creative Writing Program, Dept. of English, Temple University, Anderson Hall, Room 1020, 1114 Polett Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19122-6090.) The online application fee is $60. The paper application fee is $75. 

2. **Optional Graduate Record Examination (GRE)**: The GRE is not required to apply to the MFA Program in Creative Writing. However, if you wish to be considered for a fellowship, you are strongly encouraged to take the GRE and to have your scores for the general test forwarded electronically by ETS to Temple University by December 15. Fellowship nominations are decided by the Graduate Board, which tends to focus on traditional academic records. A minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.5 is usually required. See eligibility requirements for fellowships and teaching assistantships on the Financial Aid Information page. Scores must be from the last five years. The institutional code for Temple is 2906. The department code is 2501. 

3. **International applicants:** TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE scores should be sent to Temple University electronically by ETS or the appropriate agency. The following minimum scores are required: TOEFL score of 79/550, or IELTS score of 6.5, or PTE Academic score of 53. Please refer to the Graduate School’s [International Application page](http://www.temple.edu/grad/admissions/international.htm). 

4. **Official Transcripts:** Request that official transcripts from all institutions of higher education you previously attended (no matter how briefly, e.g., for study-abroad or as a non-matriculated student) be sent to us, either as eTranscripts to [creatwrt@temple.edu](mailto:creatwrt@temple.edu) or mailed to: Creative Writing Program, Dept. of English, Temple University, Anderson Hall, Room 1020, 1114 Polett Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19122-6090. Additionally, we ask that unofficial copies or scans of your transcripts be emailed or sent to us with the other application materials. 

5.**Creative Writing Application Form:** Fill out the one-page [Creative Writing Application Form](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/sites/liberalarts/files/CWapplicationform.pdf). This PDF form has fillable fields that may be completed on your computer. 

6. **Résumé or CV:** A personal résumé or curriculum vitae is required. Work experience—academic or non-academic—is as important as any publishing credits (the latter is not required or expected at this stage of applicants’ careers). 

7. **Personal Statement (750–1,000 words)**: Discuss literary influences and models that feed your creative work; we’re interested in which writers and texts have been important to you in recent years, as well as what critical approaches, if applicable, you have found useful. Describe your work or teaching experience. Discuss your aims in attending an MFA program. Mention what attracts you to Temple’s program and whether you’re familiar with Philadelphia. Give us a sense of who you are—a more detailed, personal picture than what can be gleaned from transcripts or résumés, especially if you have a non-traditional background or atypical undergraduate record. Double-space the lines, paginate the pages, use a standard font such as Times New Roman sized to 12 points, and have margins of at least one inch on all sides. (Although it may seem redundant, you will also be required to post a personal statement on the online Banner system for the general Graduate School application. Simply copy and paste.)

8. **Writing Sample:** Your writing sample is the most crucial single element of your application. Send a packet of writing in one genre only (poetry or fiction). For poetry, submit ten pages. These pages may include shorter poems, longer poems, and/or an excerpt from a longer project. Individual poems should be separated by page breaks, not run together. Poems may be single-spaced or formatted in whatever way you see fit. For fiction, send a total of 15–25 pages. The pages may include a single story, a series of stories, and/or an excerpt from a longer work (please identify if it is from a long story, novella, novel, or hybrid work). Double-space the lines, paginate the pages, use a standard font such as Times New Roman sized to 12 points, and have margins of at least one inch on all sides. For applicants in either genre, if you would like to include a critical essay in addition to the creative sample, please feel free to do so; it should be double-spaced and formatted like the fiction sample.

9. **Three Letters of Recommendation:** Request three signed, confidential letters of recommendation to be sent directly to us on official letterhead. Your recommendations should address your performance in previous academic, creative, and/or professional roles. Evaluators may email a PDF of the letter to [creatwrt@temple.edu](mailto:creatwrt@temple.edu) from their institutional email address, or mail the letter to: Creative Writing Program, Dept. of English, Temple University, Anderson Hall, Room 1020, 1114 Polett Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19122-6090. Please have the evaluator write “MFA Recommendation for,” followed by your full name, as the subject line of the email, or as a notation somewhere on the front of the envelope.

In addition, we may request a phone or video interview with you at a later time.
