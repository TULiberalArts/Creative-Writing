## Earn Your MFA in Creative Writing at Temple
If you are a fiction writer or poet, the graduate Creative Writing program offers fiction writers and poets the opportunity to develop your craft in a two-year MFA program. The program combines small workshops each semester, one-on-one manuscript tutorials and graduate courses in creative writing topics and literature. Workshops are supplemented by individual consultations with visiting writers-in-residence and a series of readings by prominent writers (link to Poets & Writers page). Our curriculum helps you gain technique and self-confidence and prepares you to hand in your MFA theses in your final semester. Our students are perpared to move successfully frm the MFA into the highly competitive world of submissions to journals and book publishers. 

Temple has an excellent faculty of writers in both genres, representing a wide range of aesthetics including Samuel R. Delany, Don Lee, Joan Mellen, Jena Osman, Alan Singer and Brian Teare. 

Past Faculty include noted writers and scholars that include

- David Bradley
- Rachel Blau DuPlessis
- Pattie McCarthy
- Toby Olson
- Sonia Sanchez
- Susan Stewart
- William Van Wert

## Visiting Writers
The program also hosts a visiting fiction writer and a visiting poet each year; visitors have included Peter Carey, Alexander Chee, Robert Creeley, Robert Coover, Anita Desai, Brian Evenson, C.S. Giscombe, Jaimy Gordon, Mat Johnson, Bhanu Kapil, Jonathan Lethem, Carole Maso, Anne Waldman, C.D. Wright, and Alice Notley, and many others. 

## Tinge Magazine
Students also have the opportunity to work on our online literary journal, [Tinge Magazine](http://www.tingemagazine.org/) which is graduate student-edited.

## Admission Requirements
Although not required, we prefer applicants to the MFA Program in Creative Writing to hold a bachelor’s degree in English or creative writing, or to have taken a significant number of workshops or literature classes as an undergraduate. However, in the past, students without this background have performed well in the program. Therefore, we consider the entire application package in our admission decisions.
The minimum admission standard for all graduate students is an undergraduate grade point average of B, or 3.0 (see bottom of this page for exceptions), or the functional equivalent for students who have attended universities outside of the United States.

Submit the following application materials to be considered for admission (details below):

- [Graduate School Application through Banner](https://prd-wlssb.temple.edu/prod8/bwskalog.P_DispLoginNon)

However, if you wish to be considered for a fellowship, you are strongly encouraged to take the GRE and to have your scores for the general test forwarded electronically by ETS to Temple University by December 15. Fellowship nominations are decided by the Graduate Board, which tends to focus on traditional academic records. A minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.5 is usually required. See eligibility requirements for fellowships and teaching assistantships on the Financial Aid Information. Scores must be from the last five years. The institutional code for Temple is 2906. The department code is 2501.

- Achieved a 3.25 cumulative grade point average in a least 9 credits of graduate work at an accredited university in the United States or equivalent academic performance in a university outside the United States.
- Scored above the 65th percentile on the verbal or quantitative portions of the Graduate Record Exam (or other standardized test, such as the Graduate Management Admission Test).

In special circumstances, particularly with an exceptional writing sample, other exceptions may be granted.
