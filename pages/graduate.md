## Earn Your MFA in Creative Writing
![Creative Writing MFA Poets at Temple University]({{site.baseurl}}/media/temple-mfa-poets.jpg){:.img-right}
Temple offers a two-year MFA in Creative Writing, with a focus in either fiction or poetry. Develop your craft in the poetically lively city of Philadelphia. Our program combines creative and critical practices: students take a mix of writing workshops and literature seminars augmented by one-on-one mentoring and thesis advising in the second year. Students also have the opportunity to work on our online literary journal, [TINGE Magazine](http://www.tingemagazine.org/), which is graduate student–edited. Our rich and challenging curriculum is supplemented by individual consultations with visiting Writers-in-Residence and a series of readings by [prominent writers](/creative-writing/poets-and-writers). Temple has an excellent [faculty of writers in both poetry and fiction](/creative-writing/faculty), representing a wide range of aesthetics. They include Alan Singer, Brian Teare, Don Lee, Jena Osman, Joan Mellen and Samuel R. Delany. 

Our students move successfully from the MFA into the highly competitive world of submissions to journals and book publishers. Some graduates continue on to PhD programs in English and Creative Writing and eventually work as professors. Others become librarians or work in arts administration, grant writing, journalism, publishing, primary and secondary school education, web writing and more. Books written by our graduates have been published by trade and small presses and cover all genres. These works have won grants, prizes and residencies. Temple University Creative Writing alumni continue to make important contributions to the contemporary literary scene. Please go to the [Temple University Creative Writing MFA Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/templecreativewriting/) page for current updates.

## Writer-in-Residence Program
The Creative Writing program invites a distinguished novelist (in the fall) and poet (in the spring) to stay for several days and work with MFA students. The writers attend graduate workshops, give readings, meet with students individually, read student manuscripts and spend informal time with students. Over the course of your MFA program, you will have the opportunity to engage with four of the visitors and have conferences with two of them (in their specific genre). Writers who attend the Writer-in-Residence program at Temple are a distinctive and internationally recognized group. Visiting writers have included Alexander Chee, Alice Notley, Anita Desai, Anne Waldman, Bhanu Kapil, Brian Evenson, Carole Maso, C. D. Wright, C.S. Giscombe, Jaimy Gordon, Jonathan Lethem, Robert Creeley, Robert Coover, Mat Johnson, Peter Carey and many others.

## Admission Requirements
Although not required, we prefer applicants to the MFA Program in Creative Writing hold a bachelor’s degree in English or Creative Writing, or have taken a significant number of workshops or literature classes as an undergraduate. However, in the past, students without this background have performed well in the program. Therefore, we consider the entire application package in our admission decisions.

The minimum admission standard for all graduate students is an undergraduate grade point average of B, or 3.0 (see bottom of this page for exceptions), or the functional equivalent for students who have attended universities outside of the United States. If you have questions or need further assistance, please contact Sharon Logan, the Program Coordinator, at [logansd@temple.edu](mailto:logansd@temple.edu) or [215.204.1796](tel:2152041796).

At the discretion of the vice dean and the MFA director, up to 6 graduate credits may be transferred if they were taken at a competitive university within the last five years with a grade of B+ or higher.

## MFA Application Deadline
**Feb. 15** for Fall Semester

Submit the following application materials for admission consideration. For a complete list of instructions [download this this pdf](/creative-writing/media/how-to-apply-MFA.pdf).

1. [Graduate School Application](https://prd-wlssb.temple.edu/prod8/bwskalog.P_DispLoginNon)
2. Optional GRE (recommended for fellowship consideration)
TOEFL or other tests (for international students only)
3. Official Transcripts (from all colleges attended)
4. [Creative Writing Application Form](/creative-writing/media/CWapplicationform.pdf)
5. Résumé or CV
6. Personal Statement
7. Writing Sample
8. Three Letters of Recommendation

[General Graduate Application Site](http://www.temple.edu/grad/admissions/howtoapply.htm)

All materials should be submitted or postmarked* by February 15. If you would like to be considered for a fellowship, please turn in your materials (including the optional GRE scores that are recommended for fellowship consideration) by December 15. Applications submitted after December 15 will still be considered for a fellowship (even those without the recommended GRE scores) or a teaching assistantship, but those meeting the initial deadline will be prioritized. Basically, if you are seeking funding through a fellowship or teaching assistantship, the earlier you submit your application, the better.

After the February 15 deadline, applications may still be considered on a rolling, case-by-case basis (though not for funding), depending on the availability of space and the applicant’s credentials. Inquire by emailing [creatwrt@temple.edu](mailto:creatwrt@temple.edu).

Applications are accepted only for Fall admission.

_*By “postmarked,” we mean that materials should be sent before or on December 15 or February 15. They do not need to be delivered on those dates. Regular USPS mail service, e.g., First Class or Priority Mail, is fine. You need not spend extra money on overnight services._

## Temple Graduate School Funding
Temple has several financial aid packages available to eligible candidates, including University Fellowships that provide full tuition and a stipend, as well as teaching assistantships, which also cover full tuition, health benefits and a stipend. On average, the MFA Program in Creative Writing is able to fund 40% of its students with Teaching Assistantships, University Fellowships, or Future Faculty Fellowships. These funding packages are awarded on a competitive basis. If you are admitted to the Creative Writing Program, you will automatically be considered for a Teaching Assistantship or Fellowship.

**Teaching Assistantships** require some form of instructional activity — usually teaching a composition course. A maximum of 20 hours of service per week is required. The teaching assistantship awards for 2017–18 include a health benefits, a stipend of $17,308 and a tuition waiver. Conditions of the award are determined by the graduate student union contract with Temple University. For further details, consult the Temple University Graduate Student Association’s [TUGSA](http://www.tugsa.org/) website. In general, a minimum GPA of 3.25 as an undergraduate is required for teaching assistantships.

**University Fellowships** are awarded to outstanding incoming graduate students, both domestic and international. These awards are intended to support students who demonstrate outstanding potential for success in their chosen fields. The applicant’s department determines nomination for this fellowship. Nominations are then decided by the Graduate School, which usually looks at traditional markers of academic excellence, i.e., GPA, GRE scores. University Fellowships for 2017–18 include a stipend of $22,500, tuition remission, and health benefits. University Fellows do not have to teach in their first year; however, they must serve as Teaching Assistants in their second year (and their stipends are reduced accordingly). In general, a minimum GPA of 3.5 as an undergraduate is required for University Fellowships.

**Future Faculty Fellowships** are intended to attract outstanding domestic students who would diversify the professoriate. Candidates are newly admitted domestic graduate students from underrepresented groups in the applicant’s discipline who show exceptional leadership and/or have overcome significant obstacles in pursuing an academic career. The applicant’s department determines nomination for the fellowship. Nominations are then decided by the Graduate School, which usually looks at traditional markers of academic excellence, i.e., GPA, GRE scores. Future Faculty Fellowships for 2017–18 include a stipend of $22,500, health benefits and tuition remission. Future Faculty Fellows do not have to teach in their first year; however, they must serve as Teaching Assistants in their second year (and their stipends are reduced accordingly). In general, a minimum GPA of 3.5 as an undergraduate is required for Future Faculty Fellowships.

Students who do not receive funding often work off-campus jobs and/or take out federal loans (see below) to attend the MFA program. Classes are once a week; thus, it is possible to come to campus just twice a week as a full-time student (9 credits, or 3 classes, per semester), although the class meetings are generally held during the day. 

**Federal Loan and Work-Study Programs:** Graduate students are eligible to receive education loans through the [Federal Direct Stafford Loan](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized) and [Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/plus) programs. At Temple University, unsubsidized Stafford Loans are available to full-time graduate students up to a maximum amount of $20,500 annually. There are also opportunities for [Federal Work-Study](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/work-study) jobs. The first step to determine eligibility is to complete the [Free Application for Federal Student Aid](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). Temple University’s Federal School Code is 003371. The FAFSA deadline is March 1 for fall admission. Refer to Temple’s Student Financial Services office and to the [Graduate School’s Financial Information](https://sfs.temple.edu/financial-aid-types) page for additional information. 

## Part-Time MFA Program
You have the option of going part-time over three years (6 credits, or 2 classes, per semester), or taking some classes as a non-matriculated student. If you are interested in the latter option, inquire first by emailing [creatwrt@temple.edu](mailto:creatwrt@temple.edu) at least two weeks before the start of the semester about specific classes. Check Temple’s [course schedule](http://www.temple.edu/apply/common/cdcheck.asp)(select the semester, then look under English, Graduate). If there is space and the instructor is amenable, you will most likely be asked for a writing sample and other information for further consideration if you have not already sent in a formal application. Non-matriculated students may transfer up to 9 credits for courses with a grade of B or higher upon admission to the program.

## Tuition and Fees 
Temple University is relatively affordable in comparison to other programs (see tuition information below). We have had students in the past choose Temple with no funding as opposed to other programs that offered some funding because ultimately it was a better deal for them. Also note that Pennsylvania residents receive reduced tuition at Temple (see the registrar’s [residency](http://www.temple.edu/registrar/students/registration/residency/) page for eligibility). The MFA program requires 33 total credits. Check the [Bursar’s Office](http://www.temple.edu/bursar/about/tuitionrates.htm) for current tuition rates and fees. For 2017–18, annual tuition for full-time graduate students from Pennsylvania is $15,354 (18 total credits); for full-time, out-of-state graduate students, it is $21,042. (Note that in the second year of the program, only 15 credits are required.) For part-time in-state graduate students, it is $10,236 (12 total credits); for part-time out-of-state graduate students, it is $14,028.
