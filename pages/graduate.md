## Earn Your MFA in Creative Writing
![Creative Writing MFA Poets at Temple University]({{site.baseurl}}/media/temple-mfa-poets.jpg){:.img-right}
Temple offers a two-year MFA in Creative Writing, with a focus in either fiction or poetry. Develop your craft in the poetically lively city of Philadelphia. Our program combines creative and critical practices: students take a mix of writing workshops and literature seminars augmented by one-on-one mentoring and thesis advising in the second year. Students also have the opportunity to work on our online literary journal, [TINGE Magazine](http://www.tingemagazine.org/), which is graduate student–edited. Our rich and challenging curriculum is supplemented by individual consultations with visiting Writers-in-Residence and a series of readings by [prominent writers](/creative-writing/poets-and-writers). Temple has an excellent [faculty of writers in both poetry and fiction](/creative-writing/faculty), representing a wide range of aesthetics. They include Alan Singer, Brian Teare, Don Lee, Jena Osman, Joan Mellen and Samuel R. Delany. 

Our students move successfully from the MFA into the highly competitive world of submissions to journals and book publishers. Some graduates continue on to PhD programs in English and Creative Writing and eventually work as professors. Others become librarians or work in arts administration, grant writing, journalism, publishing, primary and secondary school education, web writing and more. Books written by our graduates have been published by trade and small presses and cover all genres. These works have won grants, prizes and residencies. Temple University Creative Writing alumni continue to make important contributions to the contemporary literary scene. Please go to the [Temple University Creative Writing MFA Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/templecreativewriting/) page for current updates.

## Writer-in-Residence Program
The Creative Writing program invites a distinguished novelist (in the fall) and poet (in the spring) to stay for several days and work with MFA students. The writers attend graduate workshops, give readings, meet with students individually, read student manuscripts and spend informal time with students. Over the course of your MFA program, you will have the opportunity to engage with four of the visitors and have conferences with two of them (in their specific genre). Writers who attend the Writer-in-Residence program at Temple are a distinctive and internationally recognized group. Visiting writers have included Alexander Chee, Alice Notley, Anita Desai, Anne Waldman, Bhanu Kapil, Brian Evenson, Carole Maso, C. D. Wright, C.S. Giscombe, Jaimy Gordon, Jonathan Lethem, Robert Creeley, Robert Coover, Mat Johnson, Peter Carey and many others.

## Part-Time MFA Program
You have the option of going part-time over three years (6 credits, or 2 classes, per semester), or taking some classes as a non-matriculated student. If you are interested in the latter option, inquire first by emailing [creatwrt@temple.edu](mailto:creatwrt@temple.edu) at least two weeks before the start of the semester about specific classes. Check Temple’s [course schedule](http://www.temple.edu/apply/common/cdcheck.asp)(select the semester, then look under English, Graduate). If there is space and the instructor is amenable, you will most likely be asked for a writing sample and other information for further consideration if you have not already sent in a formal application.

## Admission Requirements
Although not required, we prefer applicants to the MFA Program in Creative Writing hold a bachelor’s degree in English or Creative Writing, or have taken a significant number of workshops or literature classes as an undergraduate. However, in the past, students without this background have performed well in the program. Therefore, we consider the entire application package in our admission decisions. The minimum admission standard for all graduate students is an undergraduate grade point average of B, or 3.0 (see our complete list of application instructions for exceptions), or the functional equivalent for students who have attended universities outside of the United States. If you have questions or need further assistance, please contact Sharon Logan, the Program Coordinator, at [logansd@temple.edu](mailto:logansd@temple.edu) or [215.204.1796](tel:2152041796).

Please visit the [Creative Writing Graduate Admissions page](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/admissions/graduate/creative-writing) to learn more about graduate program requirements and instructions on how to apply.

## Tuition and Fees
Temple University is relatively affordable in comparison to other programs (see tuition information below). We have had students in the past choose Temple with no funding as opposed to other programs that offered some funding because ultimately it was a better deal for them. Also note that Pennsylvania residents receive reduced tuition at Temple (see the registrar’s [residency](http://www.temple.edu/registrar/students/registration/residency/) page for eligibility). The MFA program requires 33 total credits. Check the [Bursar’s Office](http://www.temple.edu/bursar/about/tuitionrates.htm) for current tuition rates and fees. For 2017–18, annual tuition for full-time graduate students from Pennsylvania is $15,354 (18 total credits); for full-time, out-of-state graduate students, it is $21,042. (Note that in the second year of the program, only 15 credits are required.) For part-time in-state graduate students, it is $10,236 (12 total credits); for part-time out-of-state graduate students, it is $14,028.
