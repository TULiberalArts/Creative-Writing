## Earn Your MFA in Creative Writing at Temple
If you are a fiction writer or poet, the graduate Creative Writing program offers fiction writers and poets the opportunity to develop your craft in a two-year MFA program. The program combines small workshops each semester, one-on-one manuscript tutorials and graduate courses in creative writing topics and literature. Workshops are supplemented by individual consultations with visiting writers-in-residence and a series of readings by prominent writers (link to Poets & Writers page). Our curriculum helps you gain technique and self-confidence and prepares you to hand in your MFA theses in your final semester. Our students are perpared to move successfully frm the MFA into the highly competitive world of submissions to journals and book publishers. 

Temple has an excellent faculty of writers in both genres, representing a wide range of aesthetics including Samuel R. Delany, Don Lee, Joan Mellen, Jena Osman, Alan Singer and Brian Teare. 

Past Faculty include noted writers and scholars that include

- David Bradley
- Rachel Blau DuPlessis
- Pattie McCarthy
- Toby Olson
- Sonia Sanchez
- Susan Stewart
- William Van Wert

## Visiting Writers
The program also hosts a visiting fiction writer and a visiting poet each year; visitors have included Peter Carey, Alexander Chee, Robert Creeley, Robert Coover, Anita Desai, Brian Evenson, C.S. Giscombe, Jaimy Gordon, Mat Johnson, Bhanu Kapil, Jonathan Lethem, Carole Maso, Anne Waldman, C.D. Wright, and Alice Notley, and many others. 

## Tinge Magazine
Students also have the opportunity to work on our online literary journal, [Tinge Magazine](http://www.tingemagazine.org/) which is graduate student-edited.

## Admission Requirements
Although not required, we prefer applicants to the MFA Program in Creative Writing to hold a bachelor’s degree in English or creative writing, or to have taken a significant number of workshops or literature classes as an undergraduate. However, in the past, students without this background have performed well in the program. Therefore, we consider the entire application package in our admission decisions.
The minimum admission standard for all graduate students is an undergraduate grade point average of B, or 3.0 (see bottom of this page for exceptions), or the functional equivalent for students who have attended universities outside of the United States. 

Submit the following application materials to be considered for admission (details below):

### Graduate School Application and Creative Writing Application
- [Graduate School Application through Banner](https://prd-wlssb.temple.edu/prod8/bwskalog.P_DispLoginNon)
- [Creative Writing Application](/creative-writing/media/CWapplicationform.pdf)

### Standardized Test Scores
GRE: Recommended, but not required. Applicants who wish to be considered for a fellowship and/or teaching assistantship are strongly encouraged to include GRE scores with their admission materials (The Graduate Board decides Fellowship nominations and tends to focus on traditional academic records). Have your scores for the general test forwarded electronically by ETS to Temple University by December 15. Scores must be from the last five years. The institutional code for Temple is 2906. The department code is 2501. 
*Needs link and page to Fellowship eligibility. 

**TOEFL or other tests (for International Students only):** TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE scores should be sent to Temple University electronically by ETS or the appropriate agency. The following minimum scores are required: TOEFL score of 79/550, or IELTS score of 6.5, or PTE Academic score of 53. Please refer to the Graduate School’s [International Application page](http://www.temple.edu/grad/admissions/international.htm). 

### Official Transcripts
Request that official transcripts from all institutions of higher education you previously attended (no matter how briefly, e.g., for study-abroad or as a non-matriculated student) be sent to us, either as eTranscripts to [creatwrt@temple.edu](mailto:creatwrt@temple.edu). Additionally, we ask that unofficial copies or scans of your transcripts be emailed or physically sent to us with the other application materials. 

### Résumé or CV
A personal résumé or curriculum vitae is required. Work experience—academic or non-academic—is as important as any publishing credits (the latter is not required or expected at this stage of applicants’ careers). 

### Personal Statement (750–1,000 words)
Discuss literary influences and models that feed your creative work; we’re interested in which writers and texts have been important to you in recent years, as well as what critical approaches, if applicable, you have found useful. Describe your work or teaching experience. Discuss your aims in attending an MFA program. Mention what attracts you to Temple’s program and whether you’re familiar with Philadelphia. Give us a sense of who you are — a more detailed, personal picture than what can be gleaned from transcripts or résumés, especially if you have a non-traditional background or atypical undergraduate record. Double-space the lines, paginate the pages, use a standard font such as Times New Roman sized to 12 points, and have margins of at least one inch on all sides. (Although it may seem redundant, you will also be required to post a personal statement on the online Banner system for the general Graduate School application. Simply copy and paste.)

### Writing Sample
Your writing sample is the most crucial single element of your application. Send a packet of writing in one genre only (poetry or fiction). For poetry, submit ten pages. These pages may include shorter poems, longer poems, and/or an excerpt from a longer project. Individual poems should be separated by page breaks, not run together. Poems may be single-spaced or formatted in whatever way you see fit. For fiction, send a total of 15–25 pages. The pages may include a single story, a series of stories, and/or an excerpt from a longer work (please identify if it is from a long story, novella, novel, or hybrid work). 

Double-space the lines, paginate the pages, use a standard font such as Times New Roman sized to 12 points, and have margins of at least one inch on all sides. For applicants in either genre, if you would like to include a critical essay in addition to the creative sample, please feel free to do so; it should be double-spaced and formatted like the fiction sample. 

### Three Letters of Recommendation
Request three signed, confidential letters of recommendation to be sent directly to us on official letterhead. Your recommendations should address your performance in previous academic, creative, and/or professional roles. Evaluators may email a PDF of the letter to [creatwrt@temple.edu](mailto:creatwrt@temple.edu) from their institutional email address, or mail the letter to the department. Please have the evaluator write “MFA Recommendation for,” followed by your full name, as the subject line of the email, or as a notation somewhere on the front of the envelope.

In addition, we may request a phone or video interview with you at a later time.

### Exceptions for GPAs Less than 3.0

The Dean’s Office considers exceptions to the admissions requirement if the student meets one of these criteria:

- Achieved a 3.25 cumulative grade point average in a least 9 credits of graduate work at an accredited university in the United States or equivalent academic performance in a university outside the United States.
- Scored above the 65th percentile on the verbal or quantitative portions of the Graduate Record Exam (or other standardized test, such as the Graduate Management Admission Test).
- Earned a 3.5 grade point average during her/his final two years of undergraduate work.

In special circumstances, particularly with an exceptional writing sample, other exceptions may be granted.
