## Earn Your MFA in Creative Writing
Temple offers a two-year MFA in Creative Writing, with a focus in either fiction or poetry. Develop your craft in the poetically lively city of Philadelphia. Our program combines creative and critical practices: students take a mix of writing workshops and literature seminars augmented by one-on-one mentoring and thesis advising in the second year. Our rich and challenging curriculum is supplemented by individual consultations with visiting Writers-in-Residence and a series of readings by [prominent writers](/creative-writing/poets-and-writers). Temple has an excellent [faculty of writers in both poetry and fiction](/creative-writing/faculty), representing a wide range of aesthetics. They include Samuel R. Delany, Don Lee, Joan Mellen, Jena Osman, Alan Singer and Brian Teare.

Our students move successfully from the MFA into the highly competitive world of submissions to journals and book publishers. Some graduates continue on to PhD programs in English and Creative Writing and eventually work as professors. Others become librarians or work in publishing, arts administration, journalism, web writing, grant writing, primary and secondary school education and more. Books written by our graduates have been published by trade and small presses and cover all genres. These works have won grants, prizes and residencies. Temple University Creative Writing alumni continue to make important contributions to the contemporary literary scene.

## Writer-in-Residence Program
The Creative Writing program invites a distinguished novelist (in the fall) and poet (in the spring) to stay for several days and work with MFA students. The writers read student manuscripts, meet with students individually, give a reading, attend graduate workshops and spend informal time with students. Over the course of your MFA program, you will have the opportunity to engage with four of the visitors and have conferences with two of them (in their specific genre). Writers who attend the Writer-in-Residence program at Temple are a distinctive and internationally recognized group. Recently, the writers have included Alexander Chee, Bhanu Kapil, Brian Evenson, Cole Swenson, Craig Dworkin, C.S. Giscombe, Francisco Goldman, Jaimy Gordon, John Yau, Mat Johnson, Norma Cole, Peter Straub and Tracie Morris.

## Admission Requirements
Although not required, we prefer applicants to the MFA Program in Creative Writing hold a bachelor’s degree in English or Creative Writing, or have taken a significant number of workshops or literature classes as an undergraduate. However, in the past, students without this background have performed well in the program. Therefore, we consider the entire application package in our admission decisions.

The minimum admission standard for all graduate students is an undergraduate grade point average of B, or 3.0 (see bottom of this page for exceptions), or the functional equivalent for students who have attended universities outside of the United States. If you have questions or need further assistance, please contact Sharon Logan, the Program Coordinator, at [logansd@temple.edu](mailto:logansd@temple.edu) or [215.204.1796](tel:2152041796).

## Temple Graduate School Funding
Temple has several financial aid packages available to eligible candidates, including University Fellowships that provide full tuition and a stipend, as well as teaching assistantships, which also cover full tuition, health benefits and a stipend. Students on TAships teach in Temple’s First Year Writing Program, and may also teach Creative Writing workshops in their final semester. MFA students with funding must attend our program full-time. Students who do not receive funding from Temple may borrow funds from financial aid programs. Explore all funding and apply early to make your education an affordable experience. Refer to the [Graduate School’s Financial Information](http://www.temple.edu/grad/finances/index.htm) page to learn more.

## MFA Application Deadline
**Feb. 15** for Fall Semester

All materials should be submitted or postmarked* by February 15. If you would like to be considered for a fellowship, please turn in your materials (including the optional GRE scores that are recommended for fellowship consideration) by December 15. Applications submitted after December 15 will still be considered for a fellowship (even those without the recommended GRE scores) or a teaching assistantship, but those meeting the initial deadline will be prioritized. Basically, if you are seeking funding through a fellowship or teaching assistantship, the earlier you submit your application, the better.

After the February 15 deadline, applications may still be considered on a rolling, case-by-case basis (though not for funding), depending on the availability of space and the applicant’s credentials. Inquire by emailing [creatwrt@temple.edu](mailto:creatwrt@temple.edu).

Applications are accepted only for Fall admission.

_*By “postmarked,” we mean that materials should be sent before or on December 15 or February 15. They do not need to be delivered on those dates. Regular USPS mail service, e.g., First Class or Priority Mail, is fine. You need not spend extra money on overnight services._
