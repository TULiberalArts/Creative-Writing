## Earn Your MFA in Creative Writing at Temple
If you are a fiction writer or poet, the graduate Creative Writing program offers fiction writers and poets the opportunity to develop your craft in a two-year MFA program. The program combines small workshops each semester, one-on-one manuscript tutorials and graduate courses in creative writing topics and literature. Workshops are supplemented by individual consultations with visiting writers-in-residence and a series of readings by prominent writers (link to Poets & Writers page). Our curriculum helps you gain technique and self-confidence and prepares you to hand in your MFA theses in your final semester. Our students are perpared to move successfully frm the MFA into the highly competitive world of submissions to journals and book publishers. 

Temple has an excellent faculty of writers in both genres, representing a wide range of aesthetics including Samuel R. Delany, Don Lee, Joan Mellen, Jena Osman, Alan Singer and Brian Teare. 

Past Faculty include noted writers and scholars that include

- David Bradley
- Rachel Blau DuPlessis
- Pattie McCarthy
- Toby Olson
- Sonia Sanchez
- Susan Stewart
- William Van Wert

## Visiting Writers
The program also hosts a visiting fiction writer and a visiting poet each year; visitors have included Peter Carey, Alexander Chee, Robert Creeley, Robert Coover, Anita Desai, Brian Evenson, C.S. Giscombe, Jaimy Gordon, Mat Johnson, Bhanu Kapil, Jonathan Lethem, Carole Maso, Anne Waldman, C.D. Wright, and Alice Notley, and many others. 

## Admission Requirements
Although not required, we prefer applicants to the MFA Program in Creative Writing to hold a bachelor’s degree in English or creative writing, or to have taken a significant number of workshops or literature classes as an undergraduate. However, in the past, students without this background have performed well in the program. Therefore, we consider the entire application package in our admission decisions. 

The minimum admission standard for all graduate students is an undergraduate grade point average of B, or 3.0 (see bottom of this page for exceptions), or the functional equivalent for students who have attended universities outside of the United States. If you have questions or need further assistance, please contact Sharon Logan, the Program Coordinator, at [logansd@temple.edu](mailto:logansd@temple.edu) or [215.204.1796](tel:2152041796).

1. [Graduate School Application](https://prd-wlssb.temple.edu/prod8/bwskalog.P_DispLoginNon)

## MFA Application Deadline
-Feb. 15 for Fall Semester

All materials should be submitted or postmarked* by February 15. If you would like to be considered for a fellowship, please turn in your materials (including the optional GRE scores that are recommended for fellowship consideration) by December 15. Applications submitted after December 15 will still be considered for a fellowship (even those without the recommended GRE scores) or a teaching assistantship, but those meeting the initial deadline will be prioritized. Basically, if you are seeking funding through a fellowship or teaching assistantship, the earlier you submit your application, the better.

After the February 15 deadline, applications may still be considered on a rolling, case-by-case basis (though not for funding), depending on the availability of space and the applicant’s credentials. Inquire by emailing creatwrt@temple.edu.

Applications are accepted only for Fall admission.

*By “postmarked,” we mean that materials should be sent before or on December 15 or February 15. They do not need to be delivered on those dates. Regular USPS mail service, e.g., First Class or Priority Mail, is fine. You need not spend extra money on overnight services.
