## Writer-in-Residence Program
The Creative Writing program invites a distinguished novelist (in the fall) and poet (in the spring) to stay for several days and work with MFA students. The writers read student manuscripts, meet with students individually, give a reading, attend graduate workshops and spend informal time with students. Over the course of their program, MFA students have the opportunity to engage with four of the visitors and have conferences with two of them (in their specific genre). Writers who attend the Writer-in-Residence program at Temple are a distinctive and internationally recognized group. Recently, the writers have included Alexander Chee, Norma Cole, Craig Dworkin, Brian Evenson, C.S. Giscombe, Francisco Goldman, Jaimy Gordon, Mat Johnson, Bhanu Kapil, Tracie Morris, Peter Straub, Cole Swenson and John Yau.

## Journal of Modern Literature
The _[Journal of Modern Literature](https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/97)_ (JML) is a journal of scholarly research covering literature written in the twentieth century and beyond. It is published four times a year, including its annual review issue which consists of approximately 250 reviews, plus thousands of listings of books, articles, and dissertations that appeared during the preceding year. Temple University English professors Morton Levitt (retired) and Daniel O’Hara are two of JML’s Editors; many English faculty are on the Advisory staff. The editors welcome research-based studies of American, English and world literature published during the last century. Manuscripts should follow MLA guidelines.

## Graduate English Association
The [Graduate English Association](https://sites.temple.edu/gradenglish/) (GEA) is an organization for all graduate students in the English department, regardless of program (Literature or Creative Writing) or funding status (TA, GA, fellowship, or otherwise). The organization conducts regular monthly meetings, and its purpose is to make recommendations to the faculty on departmental issues (instructor training, program changes, etc.) and to enrich the graduate experience with developmental workshops and social events.

## Creative Writing Scholarships

Mrs. Israel was a School of Education graduate, class of 1936. This prize is given at the end of every year for the best Master’s thesis in poetry and the best Master’s thesis in fiction.
- **The Joseph Beam Scholarship Prize**: Joseph Beam was an African-American gay rights activist. He edited one of the first anthologies of gay black writing titled "In The Life". His mother, Dorothy S. Beam, EDU ’72, established the Joseph Beam Scholarship Prize when he died of AIDS. This prize is awarded annually to a student in the Creative Writing Program who has demonstrated academic achievement and financial need, and has written an essay or literary piece that would be of interest and importance to sexual minorities.
- **The William H. Gunn Scholarship in Creative Writing**: The William H. Gunn Scholarship in Creative Writing provides financial aid to graduate students enrolled in the Creative Writing program.

Gunn, a Philadelphia native, died in April 1989 at the age of 59. To the extent allowed by law, preference will be given to African American graduate students.
