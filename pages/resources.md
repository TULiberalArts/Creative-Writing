## Poets and Writers Series

_Public readings by Recognized and Emerging Authors_

The Poets & Writers Series is sponsored by the Temple University MFA Creative Writing Program, with the assistance of the Richard Moyer Fund. Each year a number of poets and fiction writers are invited to read from their work (usually on Thursdays) to members of both the Temple community and the local Philadelphia arts scene. Joining each invited writer is a writer from Temple’s graduate program in Creative Writing.

All events are free and open to the public. Readings are held either on the main Temple campus or the Center City Philadelphia Temple campus.

## Writer-in-Residence Program

The Creative Writing Program invites a distinguished novelist (in the fall) and poet (in the spring) to be in residence for several days in order to work with MFA students. These guests read student manuscripts in their genre, meet with students individually in conference, give a reading, attend graduate workshops, and spend informal time with the students over the course of their visit. During the two years of the Master’s program, students will have the opportunity to engage with four of these visitors and have conferences on their work with two of them (in their specific genre). The writers brought to Temple under this program are a distinctive and internationally recognized group. Recent Writers-in-Residence have included Alexander Chee, Norma Cole, Craig Dworkin, Brian Evenson, C.S. Giscombe, Francisco Goldman, Jaimy Gordon, Mat Johnson, Bhanu Kapil, Tracie Morris, Peter Straub, Cole Swenson, and John Yau.

## DuPlessis Lecture in Poetry and Poetics

The DuPlessis Lecture is named after Professor Emeritus Rachel Blau DuPlessis. DuPlessis is a widely published poet and critic and one of her significant contributions to the field of poetry and poetics is her interweaving of these two practices. Her poetry often speaks to the concerns of her critical work and her critical works often stretch the conventions of the scholarly essay. This lecture series honors DuPlessis’ expansions of literary form, and features poets who write in a number of different registers.
