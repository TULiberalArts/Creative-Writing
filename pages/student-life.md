The Creative Writing MFA program encourages its students to get outside the classroom and find their inspiration everywhere they can. Students can confer with our [visiting writers]((#visiting-writers-program), work as editors and manuscript readers for our online literary journal, [_TINGE Magazine_](#tinge Magazine), join the Graduate English Association, become a recipient of a [creative writing scholarship](#creative-writing-scholarships) or attend a number of [Philadelphia reading series](#local-philadelphia-reading-series).

## Visiting Writer Program
The Creative Writing MFA program invites a distinguished novelist (in the fall) and poet (in the spring) to be in residence for several days to work with MFA students. These guests read student manuscripts in their genre; meet with students individually in conference; give a reading; attend graduate workshops; and spend informal time with the students over the course of their visit. During the two years of the master’s program, students have the opportunity to engage with four of these visitors and have conferences on their work with two of them (in their specific genre). The writers brought to Temple University’s College of Liberal Arts under this program are a distinctive and internationally recognized group. Recent Visiting Writers have included:
- Alexander Chee
- Norma Cole
- Craig Dworkin
- Brian Evenson
- C.S. Giscombe
- Francisco Goldman
- Jaimy Gordon
- Mat Johnson
- Bhanu Kapil
- Tracie Morris
- Peter Straub
- Cole Swenson
- John Yau

[_TINGE Magazine_](http://www.tingemagazine.org/), Temple University’s online literary journal, is usually published twice a year, in the spring (May) and in the fall (December). The journal is edited by the graduate students of Temple’s MFA Program in Creative Writing and has an open submission policy.
