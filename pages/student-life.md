Creative writers see stories everywhere, and Temple University encourages creative writing master’s degree students to get outside the classroom and find their inspiration all around campus. Students can learn from our [writers in residence](#writer-in-residence-program), write for the [Journal of Modern Literature](#journal-of-modern-literature), join the [Graduate English Association](#graduate-english-association), apply for a [creative writing scholarship](#creative-writing-scholarships) or take part in a [Philadelphia reading series](#local-philadelphia-reading-series).

## Writer-in-Residence Program
The Creative Writing Program invites a distinguished novelist (in the fall) and poet (in the spring) to be in residence for several days in order to work with MFA students. These guests read student manuscripts in their genre, meet with students individually in conference, give a reading, attend graduate workshops, and spend informal time with the students over the course of their visit. During the two years of the Master’s program, students will have the opportunity to engage with four of these visitors and have conferences on their work with two of them (in their specific genre). The writers brought to Temple under this program are a distinctive and internationally recognized group. Recent Writers-in-Residence have included Alexander Chee, Norma Cole, Craig Dworkin, Brian Evenson, C.S. Giscombe, Francisco Goldman, Jaimy Gordon, Mat Johnson, Bhanu Kapil, Tracie Morris, Peter Straub, Cole Swenson, and John Yau.

## Journal of Modern Literature
The _[Journal of Modern Literature](https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/97)_ (JML) is a journal of scholarly research covering literature written in the twentieth century and beyond. It is published four times a year, including its annual review issue which consists of approximately 250 reviews, plus thousands of listings of articles, books and dissertations that appeared during the preceding year. Temple University English professors Morton Levitt (retired) and Daniel O’Hara are two of JML’s Editors; many English faculty are on the Advisory staff. The editors welcome research-based studies of American, English and world literature published during the last century. Manuscripts should follow MLA guidelines.

## Creative Writing Scholarships
- **The Frances Tebet Israel Prize in Poetry and Fiction**: The Frances Israel Prize was established in 1996 by her family in her memory. Mrs. Israel was a School of Education graduate, class of 1936. This prize is given at the end of every year for the best Master’s thesis in poetry and the best master’s thesis in fiction.
- **The Joseph Beam Scholarship Prize**: Joseph Beam was an African-American gay rights activist. He edited one of the first anthologies of gay black writing titled "In The Life". His mother, Dorothy S. Beam, EDU ’72, established the Joseph Beam Scholarship Prize when he died of AIDS. This prize is awarded annually to a student in the Creative Writing Program who has demonstrated academic achievement and financial need, and has written an essay or literary piece that would be of interest and importance to sexual minorities.
- **The William H. Gunn Scholarship in Creative Writing**: The William H. Gunn Scholarship in Creative Writing provides financial aid to graduate students enrolled in the Creative Writing program. The scholarship was established by William H. Gunn’s mother, Louise A. Gunn, in memory of her son, the noted black independent author, film director, playwright and scenarist. Gunn, a Philadelphia native, died in April 1989 at the age of 59. To the extent allowed by law, preference will be given to African American graduate students.
