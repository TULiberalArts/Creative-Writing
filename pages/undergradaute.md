## Creative Writing Concentration 

English majors with an interest in Creative Writing should consider a Creative Writing concentration. Such a concentration will allow for focused study of a particular genre and will provide good preparation for those students interested in graduate study in Creative Writing.

### Requirements

One 2000-level beginning workshop (in poetry, fiction, or playwriting).
One 3000-level advanced workshop (in poetry, fiction, or playwriting).
One 4096-level capstone in Creative Writing (for details, see the [Undergraduate Bulletin](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/english/ba-english-creative-writing/#requirementstext)).
-
It is assumed that you will meet these requirements in sequence; it is also recommended that you choose one genre to pursue. If you have taken Creative Acts, you will have had experience with at least two genres in order to help you make your decision. You may also want to take two 2000-level beginning workshops in different genres to help you decide which one to pursue at the more advanced levels.

### Advising

Please note that the fiction capstone class will always be offered in the fall semester, while the poetry capstone will always be offered in the spring semester. Please plan accordingly. A Creative Writing advisor will be available during registration to help you plan ahead. The advisor can also make suggestions for literature courses that will pair well with your creative study.

### Poets & Writers Series

It is recommended that all students pursuing the Creative Writing concentration attend the Poets & Writers series readings sponsored by our program. Announcements for these readings will be circulated through the English Majors listserv as well as the Creative Writing listserv.

### Creative Writing Listserv

The Creative Writing listserv will also share announcements about graduate study in Creative Writing, as well as publication opportunities. If you would like to be added to the Creative Writing listserv, please send your name and email address to Jena Osman at [josman@temple.edu](mailto:josman@temple.edu).

### Concentrators to Publish and Read their Work!

[Hyphen](http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/undergraduate/hyphen/), a student-run magazine provides a platform for students to learn editorial skills, publish their work, and create literary community on campus. Additionally, Seniors who have completed the requirements for the Creative Writing concentration will have the opportunity to share their work in a public reading at the end of the spring semester.
