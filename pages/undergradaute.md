## Study Creative Writing at Temple
If writing is your passion, Temple's Department of English offers a BA in English with a Creative Writing Concentration. As a student working in our Creative Writing Emphasis, you will be immersed in poetry and fiction and gain experience writing under the instruction of award-winning authors in supportive workshops. We recommend BA in English with Creative Writing Concentration students focus on either poetry, fiction or screenwriting. This will allow you to focuse on one particular genre and also prepare you for graduate study in creative writing if you are choose to pursue it. Like all English majors, Creative Writing Concentrations learn creative and flexible thinking, persuasive and powerful writing skills and sharp analytical skills - essential abilities for tomorrow's leaders and professionals. 

## Poets & Writers Series
It is recommended that all students pursuing the Creative Writing concentration attend the Poets & Writers series readings sponsored by our program. Announcements for these readings will be circulated through the English Majors listserv as well as the Creative Writing listserv.

## Creative Writing Listserv
The Creative Writing listserv will also share announcements about graduate study in Creative Writing, as well as publication opportunities. If you would like to be added to the Creative Writing listserv, please send your name and email address to Jena Osman at [josman@temple.edu](mailto:josman@temple.edu).
