Take your pick! Employers look for people who can think both critically and creatively. The BA in English at Temple — with its emphasis on both creative and critical scholarship, and the option of a creative writing concentration — is ideally suited to prepare students to succeed in the corporate and non-profit sectors, in academic professions and in entrepreneurial endeavors. From mayoral campaigns to musicology, recent Temple grads are putting their English degrees to work in a variety of fields and careers. English majors are prepared for careers that involve writing or editing - whether the subject matter is an advertising campaign, an essay, a grant proposal, a legal document or a website. English majors also find non-writing and editing careers in fields that include business, education, government, law, librarianship, marketing and social services.

The Department of English has a well-established internship program and offers students a wealth of opportunities to work in the real world even before graduation, and a popular career seminar keeps them up-to-date on the exciting possibilities available after graduation. Recently, English majors have secured internships in organizations across several industries, including
