Employers look for people who can think both critically and creatively. The BA in English at Temple—with its emphasis on both creative and critical scholarship and the option of a creative writing concentration—prepares students to succeed in the corporate and nonprofit sectors, in academic professions and in entrepreneurial endeavors. From mayoral campaigns to musicology, recent Temple grads are putting their English degrees to work in a variety of fields and careers, especially those that involve writing or editing—whether the subject matter is an advertising campaign, an essay, a grant proposal, a legal document or a website. English majors also find non-writing and editing careers in fields that include business, education, government, law, librarianship, marketing and social services.

### Internships
The Department of English has a well-established internship program and offers students a wealth of opportunities to work in the real world even before graduation. They’re kept up to date on exciting internship opportunities by a popular career seminar. Recently, English majors have secured internships in organizations across several industries:
