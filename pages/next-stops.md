Take your pick! Employers look for people who can think both critically and creatively. The BA in English at Temple — with its emphasis on both creative and critical scholarship, and the option of a creative writing concentration — is ideally suited to prepare students to succeed in the corporate and non-profit sectors, in academic professions and in entrepreneurial endeavors. From mayoral campaigns to musicology, recent Temple grads are putting their English degrees to work in a variety of fields and careers.
