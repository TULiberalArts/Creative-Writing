# Immerse Yourself in the Art of Writing

Our M.F.A. students work closely with faculty in fiction and poetry over the course of two years, participating in small workshops and one-on-one tutorials, as well as special topics, literature, and craft classes. Students can also take electives in theater, film, and other graduate programs throughout the university.
